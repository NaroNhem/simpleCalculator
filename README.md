# simpleCalculator
TOP calculator project

This is the final project of the TOP fundamentals course. This proejct will display my knowledge and skills 
of the concepts that I've learned up to this point in the course.

This project requires me to create a simple calculator using javascript, html, and css. The calculator should
perform basic arithmetic and display user input as well as results on a screen.

//PSEUDO CODE//

Calculator design:
Use flexbox to create a square with different containers. The calculator should contain 2 main containers:
1. Display - returns results and user input
2. Buttons - contains sub-containers that are seperated by digits, operators, and other functions(clear, backspace).
